# PostgreSQL Migration Complete

The migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL has been successfully completed. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Completed Steps

1. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Updated `config/database.yml` to use PostgreSQL
   - Modified `Gemfile` to use the `pg` gem instead of `sqlite3`

2. **Database Setup**:
   - Created PostgreSQL databases for development, test, and production
   - Created all necessary tables with proper foreign key constraints
   - Imported sample data for testing

3. **Data Conversion**:
   - Fixed boolean value conversions (0/1 to FALSE/TRUE)
   - Ensured tables were created in the correct dependency order
   - Resolved issues with numeric fields

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   bundle install
   ```

2. **Start Your Rails Server**:
   ```
   rails server
   ```

3. **Verify the Application**:
   - Access your application at http://localhost:3000
   - Test key functionality to ensure everything works correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Ensure PostgreSQL service is running
   - Check your database.yml configuration
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly

2. **Missing Tables or Data**:
   - Run `rails db:schema:dump` to generate a new schema file
   - Check the Rails console with `rails console` to verify data

3. **Rails Errors**:
   - Check the Rails logs in `log/development.log`
   - Run `rails db:migrate:status` to check migration status

## Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Set environment variables for PostgreSQL credentials:
   ```
   POSTGRES_USER=your_production_username
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_production_password
   POSTGRES_HOST=your_production_host
   ```

2. Run database migrations:
   ```
   RAILS_ENV=production rails db:migrate
   ```

3. Precompile assets:
   ```
   RAILS_ENV=production rails assets:precompile
   ```

Congratulations on successfully migrating your Rails application from SQLite to PostgreSQL!
